    <figure style = "text-align: center;">
      <img src = "Earth.jpg" width = "600" height = "500">
      <figcaption><strong>-This, ordinarliy would just be mistaken for a picture of Earth-</strong><figcaption>

    <figure style = "text-align: center;">
      <img src = "Full.jpg" width = "600" height = "500">
