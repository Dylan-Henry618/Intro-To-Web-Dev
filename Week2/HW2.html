    <strong>Week 2 Readings</strong>
  </header>

  <p>For this week's readings, there were surrounding the idea of the internet being a right that everyone should have access to and the balance of advancing technology and how creative humans can be in using it. Both bring up some interesting points that I wanted to highlight here. First I wanted to mention that I will be partial in my opinion of the internet since I do believe it is a tool that should be available for everyone to experience. And lastly, even with technology constantly evolving, I don’t think any machine will ever beat the creativity of the human mind. And it is in our constraints that we make breakthroughs and come up with truly extraordinary ideas.</p1>

  <h1>As We May Think</h1>
  <body1>
    <p2>As We May Think, by Vannevar Bush, talks about the parallels between human creativity and the advancement of technology. Someone could have a great idea about what we could do, but the situation they could be in wouldn’t allow such an endeavor to succeed. One example he uses was theoretically thinking of the possibility of making an automobile in ancient egypt during the times of the Pharaohs. Such an idea could theoretically be possible, but because of how technology and processes have developed since those times, the ability to make them would be seriously hindered and therefore be completely pointless to try to produce a single car. Whereas today, we’re capable of pumping out these machinanized death machines by the dozen for less than a fraction of the cost of what they would be back then. Cameras were also an interesting point he tried to elaborate on. What would have been unseen to the naked eye is able to be recorded and processed in a way that makes things that we wouldn't have been able to either likely see or experience at all. What comes to mind for me is how drone technology has evolved. The sites you can see at no risk to you, and filming anything becomes a really interesting prospect. A prospect that is entirely reliant on the creativity of the user. Like a calculator, the technology is effectively useless unless the user has the creativity to use it and challenge what the limits for this technology can do.

  <h2>Long Live the Internet</h2>
  <body2>
    <p3>Long Live the Web, by Tim Berners Lee, is an article about the ways corporations have tried to stifle people’s rights to the internet. When we think of the freedom of speech, most people don’t think of ways to profit off of the air people have to exert in order for the words to become what they are once they’re out there. The internet however is different because so many people rely on it for just about anything. From chat rooms, shopping and other services, the amount of information someone can acquire on anyone else with access to that becomes quite invaluable. Unfortunately, our overlords at Google are constantly monitoring our searches we make and will tailor make advertisements so they appeal to that particular customer. If you happen to be a gamer, you can expect a lot more advertisements around the latest games that are to come out. It’s not just them, social media platforms do this all the time as well as monitoring what you are watching and make sure to flood your feed with that kind of content so you keep watching and stay on the platform. For me, I never have a problem getting flooded with cute dog videos or funny cat fails, but to others that can seem like an invasion of privacy, because it technically is.  The information you give to these companies/corporations tends to be quite valuable to the right group of people, so there have been many movements by internet providers to try to cash in on this apparently growing enterprise. Luckily most have failed, but it should concern people when a resource that is supposed to be their given right is challenged and at risk of being taken away either by their provider or their government.
