    <h2>Cult Classic whose reimagination almost brought the downfall of the series</h2>

        <p>Star Wars has been, will most likely continue to be one of the biggest and most popular science fiction universes of all time. And this cult classic from 2005 had almost an infinite amount of content for someone who was a fan of the series. Being a game ported to the PC only did it favors as Mods have not only remastered the game to bring to current game standards, but also allowed the community to modify the galaxy so that they can play in the Star Wars world in battles of their own choosing.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for Star Wars fans, the series would be reimagined when the rights to Star Wars games changed in 2013. With the release of a new game, fans were disapointed with how little the remake offered in terms of content and the lack of mods that could addded to the game. The series even took out the entire clone Wars in its gameplay leaving the standard Empire vs Rebellion that everyone knows and loves. It wasn't a bad game, but just dispointing.</p>

      <p>The series would eventually get a sequel which although looked promising, promising all three eras that Star Wars fans have been growing to love, the game was plagued by the dreaded lootbox system which nearly killed it. Eventually the game would go through many updates and would be a very great game, but the game serves more as a cautionary tale of what a game shouldn't do at launch. As well as demonstrate what disasters can come from losing the essence of what made the original games so great.</p>
