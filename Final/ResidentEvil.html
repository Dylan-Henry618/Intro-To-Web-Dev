        <p>Resident Evil has been one of the most tested series ever since it's initial debut in 1996. Although setting new boundaries in the gaming landscape, the series would rise and fall with its sequels which became more and more action packed thanks to rise of modern shooters. However Resident would receive several remakes and remasters that would serve quite well to revive the 'horror' aspect of this game series.</p>
