        <p>These are just a handful of the recent game releases that have done extraoridinarly well either because they brought life to what would have been a dead series, or they have managed to recreate the charm that made their originals so great and then added more on top. I hate saying these should be the 'ideal' or 'perfect' remasters as this will just seem like the new normal for any future games that are made, but it's hard to argue when it becomes something that is so thoughtful and well made.</p>

      <p>These games on the other hand should serve as cautionary tales for their own reasons. Not all of these games are truly awful today, but either the journey they've had to go through to get to the point would have destroyed any other game. Whether greed or the lack of understanding of what made these games so iconic or legendary for their time should be both respected and cherished before games like these could tear the confidence of players down.
