    <p>For my project, I wanted to breath a bit more life into what my midterm was all about. So for the purposes of this project, I will be focusing mainly on taking the same main points of my midterm and making them a bit more interactive. Images behaving differently and having dynamic backdrops for people when they scroll through the page.</p>
